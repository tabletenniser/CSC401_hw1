We explored the following methods to futher improve test classification rate on WEKA:

We obtained a list of words tagged as having positive feelings and another tagged for negative feelings,
the statistics of the occurence in each tweet is added to the features extracted. The resulting test
classification rate is:
NaiveBayes: 66.3% (67.2% on training set)
SVM (SMO):  68.8% (69.3% on training set)
J48 (tree): 67.7% (82.3% on training set)

We further verify that the new features included indeed are the sources of improvement for our classification rate
