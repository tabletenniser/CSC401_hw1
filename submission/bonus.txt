We explored the following methods to futher improve test classification rate on WEKA

1- Additional Features
    We obtained a list of words tagged as having positive feelings and another tagged for negative feelings,
    the statistics of the occurence in each tweet is added to the features extracted. The resulting test
    classification rate is:
    NaiveBayes: 66.3% (67.2% on training set)
    SVM (SMO):  68.8% (69.3% on training set)
    J48 (tree): 67.7% (82.3% on training set)

    We further verify that the new features included indeed are the sources of improvement for our classification rate
    by checking their information gain, result below:

2- Try out different classifiers
In order to select the best classifier for our problem, we used WEKA GUI to run 10-fold cross validation and select the best classifier based on the cross validation result. After trying a whole set of combinations of different classifiers, it seems that Dagging (voted average of a classifier trained on different subsets of the training set) on J48 decision tree has the best cross validation of 68.9% and it achieves a classification rate of test set of 69.6%. This result can be reproduced by the command "java -cp weka/weka.jar weka.classifiers.meta.Dagging -F 10 -S 1 -W weka.classifiers.trees.J48 -t train_gid55_bonus.arff -T test_bonus.arff. Below is the output from this command:
